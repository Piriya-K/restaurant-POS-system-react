# About This Project

This is a project of a point-of-sales (POS) system for a restaurant.

## Use Case

In this POS system, the user can:

### `Punch Order (Done)`

On the OrderPage, use will see all the menu categories. By clicking on a category, all menu items of that category will appear on screen. Clicking on a menu item will add that item to the `itemList`, which will also appear on screen - item name, price, quantity and value (quantity * price). The total value of that order will also appear on screen.
